# Up To Date

Up To Date is a Slack bot that provides you with a personalised feed of announcements, news, and happenings.

## How Do I Use It?

For the moment, you can only use Up To Date if you're in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack). Start by running `/getmeuptodate`. From there, you can select topics and channels that interest you. Whenever a post associated with one of your chosen topics or channels is created, you'll receive a DM with its contents. You can select new topics and channels at any time by running `/getmeuptodate` again.

### How To Post

Posts are created with the `/utdpost` command. This command will open up a modal where you can write your post in the rich text editor. When you're done, you can send it off to be delivered to the relevant feeds!

### How To Add a Topic

Adding topics works similarly to creating posts. You can use the `/utdtopic` command to open up another modal. You will need to choose the topic's name and ID, and once submitted, your topic will appear immediately in the `/getmeuptodate` message and the `/utdpost` modal.

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

If you find a bug or have a feature request, you can either create an issue or DM [@Craig](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/D07FBU5TZ4L) on Slack. Make sure to check for existing open issues before opening a new one or DMing me.
